Andrea Ruffino is a research scientist in the domain of analo/mixed-signal/RF IC design. He has been working on the topic of cryogenic CMOS circuit design and he has 7+ years of experience in analog, mixed-signal and RF IC design for quantum.

He obtained his Ph.D. at EPFL, working between EPFL and TU Delft, focusing on the design of cryo-CMOS transceivers for spin qubit readout and control.
Then he has gained industrial experience in the design of cryo-CMOS circuits for spin and superconducting qubits at IBM Research - Zurich.

He has completed 7+ tape-outs, during which he has gained experience in the design of analog, mixed-signal and RF circuit blocks as well as complex systems-on-chip (SoCs) in several deep submicron and FinFET CMOS technologies.

He is a published author at Nature Electronics, JSSC, EDL, ISSCC, RFIC, ESSCIRC and his Ph.D. thesis was nominated for several EPFL awards.
