Andrea Ruffino is a research scientist in the domain of analog/mixed-signal/RF IC design. He has 7+ years of experience, mostly working on the topic of cryogenic CMOS circuit design for quantum.

He obtained his Ph.D. at <a href="https://aqua.epfl.ch/" style="color:#FF3636;">EPFL</a>, working between EPFL and <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/quantum-computer-engineering/sections/quantum-circuits-architectures-and-technology/groups/quantum-integrated-circuits" style="color:#2698BA;">TU Delft</a>, focusing on the design of single-chip cryo-CMOS transceivers for spin qubit readout and control.
Then he has worked on the design of cryo-CMOS circuits for spin and superconducting qubits at IBM Research - Zurich.

He has completed 7+ tape-outs, getting involved in the design of analog, mixed-signal and RF circuit blocks as well as complex systems-on-chip (SoCs) in several deep submicron and FinFET CMOS technologies.

He is a published author at Nature Electronics, JSSC, EDL, ISSCC, RFIC, ESSCIRC and his Ph.D. thesis was nominated for several EPFL awards.
